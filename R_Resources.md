<p>This page contains the resources you need to get started with coding in R. While this guide is intended for science students, the resources here are still quite general and can be used for a variety of applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each resource is hyperlinked with a description below the link on how it is intended to be used</p>

<p>When learning a new technique, there is sometimes some confusion when you come across terminology you haven&#39;t hard before, even when using resources designed for beginners. Some common terms that can cause confusion among beginner R users can be found below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: R is the software environment that is normally used for statistics and data visualization. Note that you cannot &quot;interact&quot; with R on its own. You will need to download R Studio.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>R Studio</strong>: this is the most popular application for coding in R.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Posit:&nbsp;</strong>The company that maintains R recently changed their name. You may see official resources listed under R or under Posit, it is the same organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Base R:&nbsp;</strong>This is how people commonly refer to the set of functions that come pre-installed when you download R for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Package: </strong>These are the extra elements of code that you need to download on your own to do specific analyses. Base R is not extensive, and you will often need extra packages to complete your work.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CRAN:&nbsp;</strong>Comprehensive R Archive Network. You can think of this as the app store for the different R packages and software.</p>
