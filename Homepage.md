However, the primary resources and tutorials would suit anybody looking to start working with R.&nbsp;It is assumed that you have no formal training in computer science.</p>

<p><strong>How do I use this guide?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You may not need to use every resource found on this page. There is a variety of resources on this page, what you use will depend on what kind of analysis you want to do. It may also depend on your learning style. There are theory-heavy tutorials, practical tutorials and videos that can be used to help with your introduction to R for bioinformatics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two tabs on this guide, one for <a href="https://mcgill-lis.libguides.com/c.php?g=733912&amp;p=5277946">general R resources </a>and another for <a href="https://mcgill-lis.libguides.com/c.php?g=733912&amp;p=5278933">bioinformatic-specific resources</a>. Within each tab, different content is organized into boxes. Within the boxes, you will find a tab for the resources themselves and another tab with APA citations for the resources in that box in case you need them.</p>
